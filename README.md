## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, Express, Boostrap, SCSS

**Frontend:** Used ejs, Bootstrap

I built PawsitivelyAdorable using a combination of frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, together with EJS as the template engine. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express.js to create a server, and followed the MVC architecture to organize the code. To store and retrieve data, I used MongoDB. To handle images, I used Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management platform, and multer, a middleware for handling file uploads. This helped me to create a fast, efficient and visually appealing website that meets the needs of its users.

I followed the MVC architecture to organize the code, and used Cloudinary and Multer to handle image uploads and processing. This helped me to create a website that's efficient, responsive and easy to maintain, and improves the overall performance and scalability of the website.

Overall, I believe that my choice of technologies helped me to create a fast, efficient, and visually appealing website that meets the needs of its users.
