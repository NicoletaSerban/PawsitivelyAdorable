## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, Express, Boostrap, SCSS

**Backend:** Node.js server with Express.js, written using the MVC architecture and MongoDB for database

**Frontend:** Used ejs, Bootstrap

I built PawsitivelyAdorable using a combination of frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, together with EJS as the template engine. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express.js to create a server, and followed the MVC architecture to organize the code. To store and retrieve data, I used MongoDB. To handle images, I used Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management platform, and multer, a middleware for handling file uploads. This helped me to create a fast, efficient and visually appealing website that meets the needs of its users.

I followed the MVC architecture to organize the code, and used Cloudinary and Multer to handle image uploads and processing. This helped me to create a website that's efficient, responsive and easy to maintain, and improves the overall performance and scalability of the website.

Overall, I believe that my choice of technologies helped me to create a fast, efficient, and visually appealing website that meets the needs of its users.

## Optimizations

- Adoption Application: Adding an online adoption application form that allows users to apply to adopt an animal directly through the website, streamlining the adoption process.

- Foster Application: Similar to adoption application, adding an online foster application form that allows users to apply to foster an animal directly through the website.

- Volunteer Application: Adding a volunteer application form that allows users to apply to volunteer at the shelter or with the rescue organization.

- Digital Contract: Creating a digital adoption contract that can be signed electronically, saving time and reducing paperwork.

- Add a Dark-theme option.

- Newspaper: different sections for volunteers (search & wanted to), lost&found animals etc.

- Create a chat box where you can give and recive information in real-time.

- Adding new improvements using React

- Adding the feature 'lazy loding' for multiple posts

- Adding a new section where the users cand verify if a specific food is safe for theier pets, using my own API

## Lessons Learned:

Building PawsitivelyAdorable taught me several valuable lessons. One of the most important ones was the importance of proper organization and planning. By following the MVC architecture, I was able to keep the codebase organized and make it easier to maintain and scale in the future. Another important lesson was the benefits of using cloud services, by using Cloudinary I was able to reduce the load on the server and improve the website's scalability. Additionally, I learned the importance of testing and debugging, by testing the website and debugging any issues that arose, I was able to ensure that PawsitivelyAdorable functioned as intended and provided a smooth user experience. Choosing the right tools for the job was also crucial, by selecting the appropriate technologies and libraries, I was able to create a website that was both efficient and visually appealing. Security was also a important aspect of the project, I had to take extra steps to ensure that the website was secure and protected against malicious attacks. Lastly, I learned the importance of user experience, by focusing on the user experience and making sure that the website was easy to navigate, I was able to create a website that was both functional and enjoyable to use.
